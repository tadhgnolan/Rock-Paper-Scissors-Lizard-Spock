## UX

### Colour Scheme

The color shceme references Twitch.tv, one of the most popular streaming websites in the world. I chose this, as it would be a vibrant, but familiar color scheme.

I used Adobe Color Wheel to check for color blind conflicts and c correct use of contrast.

-  Grey used for primary text.
-  Linear gradient of `#5F00EA 0%, #EC407A 50%, #FDD835 100%` used for background

- `#CCCCCC` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/5f00ea-ec407a-fdd835) to save my colour palette.
